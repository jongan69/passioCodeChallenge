## TL;DR:

### An app with a form for Height and Weight that can recalculate form values on Unit change With the ability to save and pull from storage 

We estimate that this challenge should take 2-4 hours to complete. We expect you to review the requirements and reply in an email with clarifying questions to remove ambiguity if needed. If you feel that the challenge is going to take much longer than 2-4 hours, please let us know!

Create a React Native form screen with the following fields:

Weight (numeric keyboard input)

Height (numeric keyboard input)

Units (multi-select with options “imperial” and “metric”)

Units should default to imperial.

For imperial units, weight should be in lbs and height should be in feet and inches.

For metric units, weight should be in kilograms and height should be in meters.

Unit labels (lbs, ft, kg, m) should be rendered to the right of the corresponding input fields.

When the units selection is changed, the height and weight values should be recalculated and the unit labels should be updated.

Include a “Save” button at the bottom that stores the data as a JSON file on disk. When the app is launched, attempt to load the same JSON file and render its values in the form.

Please implement this form using React Native, TypeScript, React hooks, and a state management solution like redux or simply useReducer.

The code should be well-typed and not use any or unknown types.

Please implement unit tests to verify the form renders correctly and that changing the units properly recalculates the height and weight values.

Outside of these requirements, feel free to use whatever tools and techniques you prefer to showcase your skills and please feel free to make the form look nice with good styles.

How to deliver: Please upload your app to a new GitHub repo and share with us.

Please document everything required for us to run / test the app in the README.
